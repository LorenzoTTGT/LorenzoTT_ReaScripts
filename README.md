ALLPASS live
Exploring machine learning concepts applied to audio, the ‘Lazy Terms’ project exemplifies sounds pushing popular music sound types (from traditional to dance) to a closed, ad hoc and abstract dynamical system.
The presented music displays a ‘coherent ambiguity’ feeling avoiding the lack of contents associated with unpredictable contemplation and willing to provoke attentional shifts, cognitive dissonance states which lets the only disposable function grounded in pure lyrical emotion.  
In Allpass music each sound is early generated in a multichannel (4 to 8 channels) configuration, down mixed if needed, always aiming to a 3D immersive experience.
